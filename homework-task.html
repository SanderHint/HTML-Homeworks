  <p><h1>The House that Jack Built lyrics<br></h1>

  <h2>This is the house that Jack built.<br>
  This is the malt<br>
  That lay in the house that Jack built.<br>
  <br>

  This is the rat,<br>
  That ate the malt<br>
    That lay in the house that Jack built.<br></h2>
  <br>
  <h3>This is the cat,<br>
  That killed the rat,<br>
  That ate the malt<br>
  That lay in the house that Jack built.<br>
  <br>
  This is the dog,<br>
  That worried the cat,<br>
  That killed the rat,<br>
  That ate the malt<br>
  That lay in the house that Jack built.</h3><br>
  <br>
  <h4>This is the cow with the crumpled horn,<br>
  That tossed the dog,<br>
  That worried the cat,<br>
  That killed the rat,<br>
  That ate the malt<br>
    That lay in the house that Jack built.</h4><br>
  <br>
  This is the maiden all forlorn,<br>
  That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,<br>
  That tossed the dog,<br>
  That worried the cat,<br>
  That killed the rat,<br>
  That ate the malt<br>
  That lay in the house that Jack built.<br>
  <br>
  This is the man all tattered and torn,<br>
  That kissed the maiden all forlorn,<br>
  That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,<br>
  That tossed the dog,<br>
  That worried the cat,<br>
  That killed the rat,<br>
  That ate the malt<br>
  That lay in the house that Jack built.<br>
  <br>
  This is the priest all shaven and shorn,<br>
  That married the man all tattered and torn,<br>
  That kissed the maiden all forlorn,<br>
  That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,<br>
  That tossed the dog,<br>
  That worried the cat,<br>
  That killed the rat,<br>
  That ate the malt<br>
  That lay in the house that Jack built.<br>
  <br>
  This is the cock that crowed in the morn,<br>
  That waked the priest all shaven and shorn,<br>
  That married the man all tattered and torn,<br>
  That kissed the maiden all forlorn,<br>
  That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,<br>
  That tossed the dog,<br>
  That worried the cat,<br>
  That killed the rat,<br>
  That ate the malt<br>
  That lay in the house that Jack built.<br>
  <br>
  This is the farmer sowing the corn,<br>
  That kept the cock that crowed in the morn.<br>
  That waked the priest all shaven and shorn,<br>
  That married the man all tattered and torn,<br>
  That kissed the maiden all forlorn,<br>
  That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,<br>
  That tossed the dog,<br>
  That worried the cat,<br>
  That killed the rat,<br>
  That ate the malt<br>
  That lay in the house that Jack built.<br></p>
